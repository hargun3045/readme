$ git config --global user.name

$ git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
```

## Pickling

```
with open ("filename", "wb") as f:
    pickle.dump(listOrdictionary, f)    
```

To open it elsewhere:

```
with open("filename","rb") as f:
    listOrDictionary = pickle.load(f)
```

## Shelving

Difference between pickling and shelving is that pickling is like anywhere available variable, while shelving is an anywhere available dictionary

```
import shelve
with shelve.open("filename") as f:
    f["key"] = listOrDictionary
```

Now to access it, get the file in the right directory

```
with shelve.open("filename") as f:
    listOrDictionary = f["key"]
```


## JSON

JSON files are available on the net, these map to dictionaries
```
import json
with open("data/us-states.json") as fd: 
    data = json.load(fd)
```
